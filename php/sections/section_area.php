                    <p class="pabout">Acapulco is a truly world-class resort and amongst Mexico's most established and renowned tourist destinations. Acapulco is based around an arching, picture-postcard bay (Bahia de Acapulco). Our Acapulco vacation rental condo is but a short walk from some of the loveliest beaches in all of Mexico. 
We are close to air-conditioned shopping centers, and quality Mexican dining venues with multi-language menus. As well as its beautiful coastal scenery, Acapulco also enjoys a stunning backdrop provided by the Sierra Madre del Sur Mountains.</p>

                    <p class="pabout">The resort of Acapulco is famous for its endless sunshine, glorious golden sandy beaches, exciting nightclubs, lively bars, and La Quebrada's daring cliff divers. For a touch of history, head to the Old Acapulco district (Acapulco Tradicional / Nautico), which is only a short distance from the condo in Acapulco. </p>

                    <p class="pabout">Many of the main tourist attractions in Acapulco are based around the coastline and just minutes away from our vacation rental condo in Acapulco. They include all kinds of water sports, such as water skiing, parasailing and riding on fun banana boats. Sport fishing is also popular and offers tourists the chance to catch some enormous marlin and even sharks. </p>

                    <p class="pabout">Others come to Acapulco for its scuba diving and snorkeling opportunities, with a number of spectacular coral reefs waiting to be explored, or for the opportunity to swim with dolphins at Delfines Paradise. For families in Acapulco, there is plenty of interest, such as Aca Zoo on the neighbouring Isla La Roqueta, the Magico Mundo Marino theme park and aquarium, the CiCi water park, and Parque Papagayo (Papagayo Park), where recreational activities abound. </p>
